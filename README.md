# Attendance App

Attendance App is a mobile application developed using Android Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, designed to help students track their attendance for various subjects efficiently.

## Features:

- **Subject Management**: Students can add and manage subjects from the navigation panel's subjects section. All subjects are displayed here for easy access.

- **Attendance Tracking**: The home screen displays all subjects along with the number of attended and absent lectures. Students can click on a subject to mark their attendance for specific lectures. The attendance screen also shows the present and absent lecture dates and displays the attendance percentage in a Doughnut pie chart.

- **Overall Attendance**: The overall attendance screen displays the overall attendance percentage in a Doughnut pie chart. It also shows the attendance for each subject.
